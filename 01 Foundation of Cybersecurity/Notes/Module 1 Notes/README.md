Module 1 Get started with Cybersecurity
•	Introduction to Cybersecurity

-Cybersecurity: The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protecting the networks, the devices, the people and the data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

- Responsibilities of entry -level Security Analyst
1.	Responsible for monitoring and protecting information systems
2.	Protecting computer and network systems (participate in penetration testing & ethical hacking), check for weakness in the network or hack the internal network to identify vulnerabilities and fixing them
3.	Installing prevention software 
4.	Conducting periodic security audits
              - Key cybersecurity terms and concepts
1.	Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
2.	Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
3.	Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
4.	Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
5.	A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
6.	An internal threat: can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
7.	Network security: is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.
8.	Cloud security: is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. 
9.	 Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
•	Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
•	Reviewing web traffic 
•	Alerting suspicious activity




•	Core skills of Security Professionals
-	Core skill of Security Professionals Soft  and technical  skills
1.	Soft Skills(transferable Skills)
1.	Communication
2.	Collaboration
3.	Analysis
4.	Problem Solving
5.	Time Management
6.	Growth mindset
7.	Diverse perspectives
2.	 Technical skills 
1.Programming language
2. Security information and event management (SIEM) tools -tools used to identify, analysis threats, risk and vulnerabilities. E.g SIEM tool will alert you when unknown user try to access the system, you may use computer forensic to investigate the systems
  3. Computer forensics:
 Cybersecurity Analyst needs intellectual curiosity and motivations to succeed. Spend more times on pythons and SQL
 4. Introsion Detection Systems(IDS)
  Monitors systems activities and alerts for possible intrusion E.g using IDS to monitors network for signs of malicious activity, like unauthorised access to a network
   5. Threat landscape knowledge
    6. incident response
•	The importance of cybersecurity 
- Business Continuity
-Ethical Standing
-Protection of intellectual property
-Trust
-Legal protection. E.g litigation after data breach

Detail Explanation
-Security is essential for ensuring an organization's business continuity and ethical standing. There are both legal implications and moral considerations to maintaining an organization's security. 


A data breach, for example, affects everyone that is associated with the organization. This is because data losses or leaks can affect an organization's reputation as well as the lives and reputations of their users, clients, and customers. 

By maintaining strong security measures, organizations can increase user trust. This may lead to financial growth and ongoing business referrals.

 As previously mentioned, organizations are not the only ones that suffer during a data breach. Maintaining and securing user, customer, and vendor data is an important part of preventing incidents that may expose people's personally identifiable information. 

Personally identifiable information, known as PII, is any information used to infer an individual's identity. PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information. Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as SPII, is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. 
If SPII is stolen, this has the potential to be significantly more damaging to an individual than if PII is stolen. PII and SPII data are key assets that a threat actor will look for if an organization experiences a breach. When a person's identifiable information is compromised, leaked, or stolen, identity theft is the primary concern. Identity theft is the act of stealing personal information to commit fraud while impersonating a victim. And the primary objective of identity theft is financial gain.
